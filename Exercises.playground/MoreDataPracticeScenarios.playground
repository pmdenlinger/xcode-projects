🧠 HOW TO APPROACH THESE SCENARIOS:

1️⃣ DAILY PONDERING (5-10 minutes):
   • Pick one scenario each day
   • Think about it during commute, walks, or downtime
   • Don't force solutions - let your mind wander

2️⃣ KEY QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF:
   • "What are the core data entities here?"
   • "What relationships exist between them?"
   • "What would users want to calculate or analyze?"
   • "What edge cases or special situations exist?"

3️⃣ PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY:
   • Start with basic data storage (structs, arrays)
   • Add computed properties and methods
   • Consider error handling and edge cases
   • Think about performance and scalability

4️⃣ REAL-WORLD CONSIDERATIONS:
   • How would data be input by users?
   • What reports or visualizations are needed?
   • How does data change over time?
   • What privacy or security concerns exist?

5️⃣ PATTERN RECOGNITION:
   • Notice similar patterns across scenarios
   • Identify reusable components
   • Recognize when to use structs vs classes
   • Spot common algorithmic challenges

🔄 WEEKLY REVIEW ROUTINE:
   
   Monday: Pick 3 scenarios to think about this week
   Tuesday-Thursday: 10 minutes of casual thinking per day
   Friday: Try to sketch out data models for one scenario
   Weekend: Code up a simple version if inspired

💡 BREAKTHROUGH MOMENTS HAPPEN WHEN:
   • You're not actively trying to solve the problem
   • You see connections between different scenarios
   • You recognize patterns from your own life
   • You suddenly understand a complex relationship

🎯 REMEMBER:
   • Solutions don't need to be perfect
   • Focus on understanding the problem first
   • Every scenario teaches something valuable
   • Your intuition will grow with each one you consider
